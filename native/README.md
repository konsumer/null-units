This implements a headless native host for null-units. It's not at all ready, I am still working on it.


### ideas

- presets for loading, routing, and initial parameters
- OSC messages (over udp and websockets) automatically tied to every unit for live-control
- preload data (audio files) from CLI options
- change unit dir from CLI options
